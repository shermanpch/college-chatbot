College Documents:
Below is a concatenated list of college documents. Each document is clearly marked with its ID using the following format:
```
--- DOCUMENT ID: {{document_id}} ---
{{document_content}}

```
{concatenated_document_contexts}

Instructions:
1. Review the student's preferences carefully, understanding both the clarifying questions and their specific answers.
2. Carefully read through each college document provided in the "College Documents" section above.
3. Rank the documents from 1 (most relevant) to N (least relevant) based on how well they align with the student's preferences. Every document provided must be assigned a unique rank.
4. For each document, provide a detailed and comprehensive reason explaining its rank. Address the student directly using "you" and "your" language. Consider all aspects of the student's preferences and how the college matches or doesn't match their stated criteria.
5. CRITICAL: Use the exact document_id as shown between the "--- DOCUMENT ID: [id] ---" and "--- END DOCUMENT ID: [id] ---" markers in the College Documents section. Do not make up document IDs.

Output Format:
Respond with a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "rankings": [
    {{"rank": 1, "document_id": "ACTUAL_DOCUMENT_ID_FROM_ABOVE", "reason": "This college is ranked highest for you because [detailed explanation addressing multiple aspects of your preferences and how this school aligns with your stated criteria, including specific features that match your preferences and explanation of why this ranks above other options]."}},
    {{"rank": 2, "document_id": "ANOTHER_ACTUAL_DOCUMENT_ID", "reason": "This college ranks second for you because [detailed explanation covering specific aspects that align with your preferences and areas where it might not perfectly match but still offers value]."}},
    ...continue for all documents...
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: Replace "ACTUAL_DOCUMENT_ID_FROM_ABOVE" with the real document IDs from the College Documents section. Only output the JSON object.
